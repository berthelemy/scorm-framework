.h1 SCORM Framework

.h2 Background

It seems like elearning development houses either build their own frameworks to retain maximum control over the output, or use an authoring tool, with no control.

This framework endeavours to provide a starting point for people who can tweak code, or for people who just want to edit a simple set of markdown pages.
